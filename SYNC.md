# Repository sync status

No `origin` remote is configured in this workspace, so there is currently no upstream `main` branch to pull from. Once a remote is available, add it with `git remote add origin <url>` and run `git fetch origin main` followed by `git merge origin/main` to bring this branch up to date.
